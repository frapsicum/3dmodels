## Monoprice mini delta calibration
Mini delta was calibrated by printing Calibration.stl model and then measuring the actual X, Y, Z dimensions. We can scale the model accordingly. This gives accurate enough models in practice. Note that these numbers are specific to my printer.

Most of these models are also available on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/nsethi/designs)

```
Expected X = Y = Z = 20
Actuals:
X = 19.59
  = 102.10%
Y = 19.7 19.54 19.50
  = 19.41
  = 103.04%
Z  =  19.66
     =  101.73%
